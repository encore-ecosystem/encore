# Publishing Packages

## Custom registry service

Set `ENCORE_DEFAULT_INDEX` once in your environment to select a service for all
projects. A project can override that default in its root manifest:

```toml
[registry]
index = "https://packages.example.org/index"
```

`encore publish` discovers its schema-1 API at `<index>/config.json`, uploads in
64 KiB chunks and asks the service to commit the SHA-256-verified archive.
Authenticated publication uses the native HTTP client, not curl. Requests stay
on the index origin and never follow redirects. A failed custom service never
falls back to GitHub. Plain HTTP is allowed only for `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`
development services; `localhost` connects directly to IPv4 loopback without DNS.

For a service advertising device authentication:

```sh
encore login
# Open the printed URL, sign in and approve the displayed device code.
encore whoami
encore publish
encore logout
```

`login`, `whoami` and `logout` accept `--registry <index-url>` outside a project.
Otherwise they use `ENCORE_INDEX_URL`, the root manifest, or
`ENCORE_DEFAULT_INDEX`, in that order. Login stores the
credential in the OS keyring, keyed by the complete canonical index URL:
libsecret on Linux, Keychain on macOS, Credential Manager on Windows. A missing,
locked or denied keyring is an error; there is no plaintext-file fallback.
Logout revokes remotely before removing the local credential. If revocation
cannot be confirmed, the local credential is retained so you can retry.

In CI, create a short-lived, package-scoped token in the registry account page.
Inject it as `ENCORE_REGISTRY_TOKEN` through your CI secret manager and set
`ENCORE_REGISTRY_TOKEN_INDEX=https://packages.example.org/index`. Both are
required: a project's registry override must not receive a token intended for
another index. Tokens never appear in command arguments or request files.
Unset `ENCORE_REGISTRY_TOKEN` before interactive login. The default legacy
GitHub index does not provide device authentication; it still uses `gh auth`.

The API path needs Git **locally** for tracked-file selection and deterministic
archives, but no commit, remote, GitHub repository, clean worktree or push.
Root path dependencies are rewritten in staging. `encore publish --dry-run`
checks and creates the archive without HTTP requests, authentication or running
tests; run `encore check` and `encore test` beforehand. The first service version
accepts at most 4 MiB compressed. Same version + identical archive is idempotent;
different bytes for an existing version are rejected. Retry the command after
an interrupted transfer. `--release-only` is not supported by this API.

## Default GitHub index

Without a custom registry, Encore uses GitHub as package storage and
[`encore-ecosystem/encore-index`](https://github.com/encore-ecosystem/encore-index) as a sparse
metadata catalog. Package source can live in any public GitHub repository. A
published version is a maintainer-created `.tar.gz` asset attached to a GitHub
Release; automatically generated source archives are not used.

Encore automates the named release and reviewed index pull request:

```sh
encore publish --dry-run
encore publish
# Override the release nametag without changing the registry epoch.
encore publish --release-name neumann
```

The dry run performs the same local verification and creates the exact archive
without changing GitHub. Normal publication uses the current `gh auth`
session. It is safe to resume when existing remote state matches exactly.

## Package Requirements

A publishable library contains at least:

```text
encore.toml
src/lib.enq
```

The manifest must use a lowercase package name of at least two characters.
Letters, digits, `-`, and `_` are accepted.

```toml
[project]
name = "example_math"
version = "1.0.0"
repository = "https://github.com/owner/example_math"
encore = ">=0.0.0"
description = "Math helpers for Encore"
readme = "README.md"
licence = "MIT"
dependencies = [
    "index@std",
]

[publish]
include = []
exclude = ["notes/**"]
```

Before publishing, `encore publish` verifies the equivalent of:

```sh
encore sync
encore format --check
encore check
encore lint
encore test
encore build
```

Published manifests must not contain `path@` dependencies. The publisher rewrites
local dependencies to exact `index@name@version` references in the staged archive,
without changing the source manifest. Those packages must be published before
consumers can resolve the archive. A private refrain may use
`workspace@name` when its complete package is included at `workspace/name` in
the same release archive. Do not include `.git`, `target`, or machine-specific
files.

## Create A Release Archive

Create an archive whose root contains `encore.toml`, not an extra repository
directory. On a GNU tar environment:

```sh
version=1.0.0
package=example_math

tar \
  --sort=name \
  --owner=0 \
  --group=0 \
  --numeric-owner \
  --mtime='UTC 1970-01-01' \
  -czf "$package-$version.tar.gz" \
  encore.toml src workspace
```

Include `README.md`, a license file, tests, examples, and native sources when
they are part of the package. Omit `workspace` from the command when the
distribution has no private refrains. Every listed path must exist; keep
generated build output out of the archive. Archives may contain only regular
files and directories; symbolic links, hard links, and special files are
rejected.

Inspect and hash the result:

```sh
tar -tzf example_math-1.0.0.tar.gz
sha256sum example_math-1.0.0.tar.gz
```

The listing must contain `encore.toml` at the archive root and must not contain
absolute paths or `..` components.

Named package releases use a nametag while manifests keep a SemVer version.
The registry epoch is a separate compatibility generation: it stays `neumann`
across subsequent named releases until an explicit index reset. The compiler
records that generation independently of its own release name. Publication
checks the upstream `index.json` before submitting an index update and refuses
an incompatible epoch. `--release-only` uploads the immutable package without
an index PR; it is reserved for staging coordinated index cutovers.

For example:

```sh
git tag -s example_math-v1.0.0-neumann -m "example_math 1.0.0-neumann"
git push origin example_math-v1.0.0-neumann
gh release create example_math-v1.0.0-neumann \
  example_math-1.0.0.tar.gz \
  --title "example_math 1.0.0"
```

Never replace an uploaded asset. If an archive is wrong, publish a new package
version and a new URL.

## Add The Index Entry

Fork `encore-ecosystem/encore-index`. Metadata paths use the first two package-name
characters:

```text
example_math -> ex/example_math.json
```

For a new package, create:

```json
{
  "name": "example_math",
  "versions": [
    {
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "epoch": "neumann",
      "nametag": "neumann",
      "release": "1.0.0-neumann",
      "archive": "https://github.com/author/example_math/releases/download/example_math-v1.0.0-neumann/example_math-1.0.0.tar.gz",
      "checksum": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
      "yanked": false
    }
  ]
}
```

For a new version, append an object to `versions`. Do not edit or reorder an
already published entry. Open a pull request containing only the relevant
metadata changes.

Index CI validates the path, schema, package name, SemVer, duplicate versions,
archive URL, SHA-256, archive paths, and manifest identity. Maintainers review
the package source, dependency references, licensing, and test evidence before
merging.

## Test Before Opening A PR

Push the metadata branch and point Encore to its immutable Git commit:

```sh
export ENCORE_INDEX_URL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<fork>/encore-index/<commit>"
export ENCORE_REGISTRY_CACHE="$(mktemp -d)"

mkdir package-smoke
cd package-smoke
encore init --name package_smoke
encore add example_math
encore build
```

Using a fresh cache proves that metadata, download URL, checksum, archive, and
transitive dependencies work together.

## Publish An Update

1. Increase `[project].version`.
2. Run package tests.
3. Create and upload a new immutable archive.
4. Append the new version to the metadata file.
5. Open an index PR.

After merge, new projects and `encore update` select the highest compatible
SemVer version. Existing projects remain on the version recorded in
`encore.lock` unless their manifest constraints can no longer be satisfied by
that locked graph.

## Yank A Version

To prevent new selection of a broken release, open an index PR changing only:

```json
"yanked": true
```

Do not delete the metadata entry or release asset. Existing lockfiles must
remain reproducible. Publish a corrected version separately.
